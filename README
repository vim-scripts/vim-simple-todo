May be this is the smallest VIM plugin in the world. It adds some useful
mappings for manage simple TODO lists and nothing more.

All this mappings work the same on NORMAL and INSERT modes.

,i      create new todo under cursor
,o      create new todo below current line
,O      create new todo above current line
,x      mark todo under cursor as done
,X      mark todo as undone
