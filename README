May be this is the smallest VIM plugin in the world. It adds some useful
mappings for manage simple TODO lists and nothing more.

[x] Create plugin
[x] Add help documentation
[x] Publish to GitHub
[ ] Spread the word

Plugin supports GitHub-like task lists
(https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) as well.

- [x] Support markdown list markers
- [x] So it's easy to create tasks in issues or pull requests on GitHub

All this mappings work the same on NORMAL and INSERT modes.

,i      create new todo under cursor
,o      create new todo below current line
,O      create new todo above current line
,x      mark todo under cursor as done
,X      mark todo as undone
